While some may find the strategies insightful, I found the book to be morally questionable and manipulative. The emphasis on deception, manipulation, and exploiting others for personal gain left a sour taste in my mouth. Additionally, the author's glorification of power dynamics and lack of ethical considerations make this book difficult to endorse. While it may offer some historical anecdotes and psychological insights, readers should approach with caution and critical thinking.",},
